| Day    | 📚 Topic                          | ⭐ Key Achievement |
| :---   | :---                              | :---              |
| Day 01 | First Python Programme            | Wrote and executed my very first Python script, building confidence in syntax and setup |
| Day 02 | Variables: Single & Multiple Use  | Practiced declaring and assigning single variables, explored multiple variable assignment in one line, and understood how Python handles values efficiently |
| Day 03 | Lists & Variable Types | Learned about Python lists and practiced creating, accessing, and modifying them; explored different variable types (int, float, string, boolean) with examples to understand how Python stores and manipulates data |
|Day 04 |  Data Types |  Explored Python’s core data types in depth (int, float, string, boolean, list, tuple, set, dict); practiced type conversion and checked types using `type()` and `isinstance()`; gained clarity on mutable vs immutable types and their practical use cases |
|Day 05 | Operators & Types | Practiced arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **, //), explored assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.), built small projects like a Discount Calculator and Week 
|Day 06| Operators: Relational, Salary, Shorthand & Logical | Practiced relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) for comparisons; applied operators in salary-based conditions; explored shorthand assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) for concise updates; strengthened understanding of logical operators (and, or, not) to combine multiple conditions effectively.|
|Day 07| Python Operators (Part‑3) | Practiced Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>) for binary manipulation; explored Identity Operators (is, is not) to compare object references; applied Membership Operators (in, not in) to check element presence in sequences like lists, strings, and sets.|
