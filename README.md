# 🐍 Python Learning Log

From HR Operations to Data Analytics—documenting my journey into **Python, SQL, and GenAI-powered insights**.

Welcome! This repository tracks my **daily progress** and **projects** while building Python skills for analytics.  
I am focusing on bridging the gap between **traditional data analysis** and **modern AI-driven workflows**.

---

🚀 **The Goal**

To build a strong foundation in **Python programming**, **data analysis**, and **visualization**, while integrating GenAI tools for faster data cleaning, workflow automation, and insight generation.

| Day    | 📚 Topic                          | ⭐ Key Achievement |
| :---   | :---                              | :---              |
| Day 01 | First Python Programme            | Wrote and executed my very first Python script, building confidence in syntax and setup |
| Day 02 | Variables: Single & Multiple Use  | Practiced declaring and assigning single variables, explored multiple variable assignment in one line, and understood how Python handles values efficiently |
| Day 03 | Lists & Variable Types | Learned about Python lists and practiced creating, accessing, and modifying them; explored different variable types (int, float, string, boolean) with examples to understand how Python stores and manipulates data |
|Day 04 |  Data Types |  Explored Python’s core data types in depth (int, float, string, boolean, list, tuple, set, dict); practiced type conversion and checked types using `type()` and `isinstance()`; gained clarity on mutable vs immutable types and their practical use cases |
|Day 05 | Operators & Types | Practiced arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **, //), explored assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.), built small projects like a Discount Calculator and Week 
|Day 06| Operators: Relational, Salary, Shorthand & Logical | Practiced relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) for comparisons; applied operators in salary-based conditions; explored shorthand assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) for concise updates; strengthened understanding of logical operators (and, or, not) to combine multiple conditions effectively.|
|Day 07| Python Operators (Part‑3) | Practiced Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>) for binary manipulation; explored Identity Operators (is, is not) to compare object references; applied Membership Operators (in, not in) to check element presence in sequences like lists, strings, and sets.|
|Day 08| Typecasting & Type Conversion (Python) | Built a safe typecasting program using ast.literal_eval and try/except; demonstrated explicit conversions (int, float, str, bool, list, tuple), implicit coercion (int+float → float), and common pitfalls (int('3.5') error; bool('False') is True); added input validation, locale-aware parsing notes, and unit‑testable conversion functions; practiced safe parsing, loss‑of‑precision handling, and prepared exercises for CSV parsing and decimal.Decimal for monetary values.|
|Day 09| Keyboard Input Program | Practiced using input() to take user input from the keyboard; built small interactive scripts that accept names, numbers, and perform operations based on user-provided values; strengthened understanding of type conversion (int(), float(), str()) to handle different input formats effectively.|
|Day 10| Decision Making Statements | Practiced writing simple if statements to execute code when conditions are true; explored if-else to handle alternative outcomes; experimented with multiple examples (2 < 3, 2 > 3) to observe how the body of the if executes or skips; strengthened understanding of indentation and scope by distinguishing inside vs. outside the if block; built confidence in controlling program flow with clear, structured conditions.|
|Day 11| Decision Making Statements Part 2 | Practiced simple if-else for binary decisions, explored elif for multiple outcomes, applied logical operators (and, or, not), built nested conditions (e.g., age + citizenship check), and created small practical programs like grade calculators, login validation, and discount systems.|
|Day 12| Decision Making Statements Part 3 | Practiced advanced elif use cases, explored nested if-else structures for layered decision-making, applied them in practical programs like classification tasks and eligibility checks, strengthening logical flow and real-world application skills.|
|Day 13| Loop Program Part 1| practiced loop program with range function and with different types of examples and formed a table to understand real world application.|
|Day 14| Loop Program Part 2| Practiced Day 13's Loops with real life examples and learnt While Loop along with its application in script form|
|Day 15| Loop Program Part 3| Learnt more about Loops, breaks, continue, applied in practical form using different examples and created prime number example|
|Day 16| Loop Program Part 4| Learnt about nested loops and practiced using few examples with different conditions|
|Day 17| Loop Program Part 5| Learnt about Fibonacci series, hands on practice with nested loop examples and practiced While loop too |
