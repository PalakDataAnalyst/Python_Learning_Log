DAY 7 Operators and types

-- Bitwise Operators
a, b = 4, 5
c = a & b
print(c)
c = a | b
print(c)
c = a ^ b
print(c)
c = a >> 1
print(c)
c = a << 1
print(c)
c = ~a
print(c)

-- Identity Operator 
a = 2
b = 2
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(a is b)
print(a is not b)
b = 3
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(a is b)
print(a is not b)

-- Mmebership Operator
values = [12, 2, 23]
print(2 in values)
print(2 not in values)
print(11 in values)
print(11 not in values)
